# Just Jump It
[live]

Just Jump It is a clone of [doodle jump](http://doodlejump.org/).

JustJumpIt is an addictive platformer. The goal of the game is to get the highest numerical score before losing. There is no end to the number of platforms, so the game can potentially go on forever! The player has to navigate their character so that it jumps and lands on a higher platform, resulting in a higher score.

## MVP

- Character that jumps when it makes contact with a platform
- Platforms that allows the player to jump
- Score is kept as the player jumps higher and higher
- Game state logic to keep track of when the game is over (when the player falls to the bottom)
